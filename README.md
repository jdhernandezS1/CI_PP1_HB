## __UXD__
Using the user experience design(UX or UE).
UXD is how a user interacts with and experiences a product, system or service.
It includes a person's perceptions of utility, ease of use, and efficiency. 
This design improve user experience of the most important companies, designers, and creators when creating and refining products because negative user experience can diminish the use of the product and, therefore, any desired positive impacts; conversely, designing toward profitability often conflicts with ethical user experience objectives and even causes harm. User experience is subjective. However, the attributes that make up the user experience are objective.
