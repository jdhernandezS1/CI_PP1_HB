                    <p>
                        Have you ever seen an obese vegetarian?
                        Do you know what is vegetarian? 
                        Do you know which Olympic field champions and track or sports stars have been and are vegetarians? 
                        Did you know that vegetarian people are statistically less likely to have heart disease, diabetes, high blood pressure or high cholesterol? 
                        Perhaps for this reason, there are more and more people who want to eat a healthier and more natural diet and have opted for a large part 
                        of their diet, or all of it, to be vegetarian. 
                        If we talk about health, it is absolutely proven that the intake of vegetables is essential to stay healthy and fit.

                        the extensive livestock would be practiced in remote environments and when deforest and degradation of the earth reflect the weakness of the political institutions.    
                        the intensive livestock production tends to crowded in low cost places, placed near to the cost or cities in where it is difficult to clean all recidues and that generate contamination

                <h2>What are the health benefits of a vegetarian diet?</h2>
                <p>There are many benefits to start a vegetarian diet when it’s followed correctly. 
                    If you’re avoiding meat but you only eating processed breads and pastas, excess sugar, 
                    and very little vegetables and fruits, you’re unlikely to reap many of the benefits of this diet.</p>
                <h2>Some benefits of the vegetarian diet</h2>
                <!-- benefits list -->

                    <p>
                        Vegetarians may be up to one-thirdTrusted Source less likely to die or be hospitalized for heart disease. Of course, 
                        food choices matter - vegetarian or not.
                        If you want the heart-protective benefits of the diet, be sure to choose:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>high-fiber whole grains</li>
                        <li>legumes</li>
                        <li>nuts</li>
                        <li>vegetables and fruits</li>
                        <li>other low-glycemic foods</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The idea is to consume soluble fiber and choose foods that’ll help keep blood sugar levels stable.
